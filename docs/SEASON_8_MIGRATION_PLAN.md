# Season 8 — Migration Plan (main `wheeldb`: 7.7 → Season 8)

> **Purpose:** Step-by-step plan to promote the staging Season 8 work to
> the live production server and execute the season rollover without the
> historical breakage (wrong season numbers, missing snapshots, un-reset
> pot, upgrade levels not cleared, missing migrations).
>
> **Target window:** Friday 26 June 2026, 23:59 BST (UTC+1) — the exact
> instant `seasons.ends_at` in `wheeldb` already expires
> (`2026-06-26 23:59:00+01`). Firing right at `ends_at` removes the
> Friday/Saturday ambiguity from the earlier draft. The 03:00 UTC daily
> backup plus the manual 22:30 BST backup (§6.7) both land well before
> this, giving the full rollback window.
>
> **Authoritative refs:**
> - `SEASON_8_BUILD_SPEC.md` — what Season 8 *is* (the design)
> - `SEASON_8_TICKETS.md` — what the work *is* (per-feature AC)
> - `SEASON_8_PROGRESS.md` — what's *done* (audit trail)
> - `seasons.py` (in `wheel-app/`) — the rollover mechanism
> - `migrations/` (in `wheel-app/`) — schema history
> - This document — how to *ship it* without breaking the live server

## 0. Audit (2026-06-26) — corrections to this plan

> This section is the audit record. The body of the plan was written
> 2026-06-23; the items below correct drift caused by later work
> (T117–T121, T200–T207) and an unresolved pre-existing bug. Inline
> changes have been made to the affected sections; this section
> summarises them.

> **Re-evaluation (2026-06-26):** for the 7.7 → 8 migration
> specifically, **most of the S8 reset-vs-preserve decisions are moot**
> because main's `wheeldb` does not have any S8 columns until
> migrations 031–054 apply. Those migrations create the columns with
> safe defaults (`0` / `FALSE` / `NULL`). At the moment the Fri 23:59
> rollover fires, every `game_state` row has `insurance_tokens=0`,
> `cosmetic_fragments=0`, `biggest_win_announced=0`, etc. — there is
> no stockpile to lose. Those decisions only matter for **future
> 8.1 → 8.2 sub-season rollovers**, which are explicitly out of scope
> per §11a.
>
> The one exception is `cumulative_wins` — migration 049 backfills
> `cumulative_wins = wins` on Thursday's promotion, so by rollover
> night the 3 active players have a real (non-zero) lifetime tally.
> The rollover UPDATE must NOT touch `cumulative_wins`. The staging
> `seasons.py` already leaves it untouched (confirmed in §6.1
> checklist), so no code change is required — this is just a
> correctness note.

### Critical (would break the rollover if not fixed)

- **`seasons.py::advance_season()` line 119 references `shield_charges`** —
  column was dropped by migration `030_drop_shield_charges.sql`. The
  function would throw `column "shield_charges" does not exist` if
  actually invoked. The existing rollover test `tests/test_rollover.py:54`
  notes this explicitly: "We can't run `advance_season()` end-to-end
  against the staging DB because the function also references columns
  the current schema no longer has (e.g. `shield_charges`, dropped by
  migration 030)." → §6.1 must include deleting that one line.
- **`UPDATE seasons` (lines 158–164) does NOT set `name = 'Casino'`.**
  Plan §6.5 says it does; reality says it doesn't. After rollover
  the new row would have `name=''`, and `get_season_info` would fall
  back to `season_name=str(season_number)` → `'9'`, not `'Casino'`.
  → §6.1 / §6.4 must add `name = 'Casino'` to the UPDATE.
- **`INSERT INTO user_season_history` (lines 85–99) only writes S7
  columns.** Even after migration 052 adds the S8 columns, the INSERT
  would write NULLs/defaults into them. → §6.2 needs both the migration
  AND the seasons.py INSERT edit.

### Defensive (would not break 7.7 → 8, but trap future sub-seasons)

These are missing reset clauses in the `UPDATE game_state` block.
**For 7.7 → 8 launch night they are no-ops** (the S8 columns are all
at default `0` / `FALSE`/ `NULL` after the migrations apply). They
would become real bugs in the first 8.1 → 8.2 sub-season if not fixed
now. Cheap to add; included in the §6.1 Phase A fix list.

- `wager_banked_losses = 0` (mirrors `wager_banked_wins = 0`)
- `gravity_drift = 0` (clears wheel-mode bias carry-over)
- `wager_last_win_amount = 0` (clears stale double-down escrow)
- `biggest_win_announced = 0` (per-season jackpots-announced-once flag;
  T90 added the column; without reset, jackpots couldn't be
  re-announced next season)

### Plan factual errors corrected inline

- Migration count: was "22 (031–052)" → **24 (031–051 + 053 + 054 + new
  052)**. T117 added migration `053_bounty_per_claim.sql`; T119 added
  `054_rename_wager_to_insurance_tokens.sql`.
- §6.2 column list had pre-T119 names: `wager_insurance_charges`,
  `wager_insurance_armed`, `wager_tokens` all renamed by migration 054.
  Updated to current names: `insurance_charges`, `insurance_armed`,
  `insurance_tokens`. Plus new columns to snapshot: `biggest_win_announced`,
  `cosmetic_fragments`, `bounty_claimed_date`, `catch_of_the_day_date`,
  `insurance_free_claimed_date`, `insurance_unlock_grant_given`.
- §2/§3 stale facts: main gunicorn PID, staging gunicorn PID, "last
  migration applied" (now `054`), `game.py:2125` (now `game.py:3093`),
  the "manual-trigger only, no cron" paragraph in §3 contradicted the
  §6.6 cron decision.
- §6.1 dry-run procedure: staging `.env` has NO `ADMIN_SECRET` (only
  main's `.env` does). Documented alternative: invoke
  `seasons.advance_season(conn)` directly from a Python REPL with a
  real `psycopg2` connection to `wheeldb_staging`, bypassing the HTTP
  endpoint and its secret check.
- §6.3 manual sub-steps: `deploy.sh` (existing on main) already
  automates merge → dry-run → apply → build → restart gunicorn. The
  §6.3 step is now "create migration 052 in main's `migrations/`, then
  run `./deploy.sh`".

### Preserve-vs-reset reference (informational only for 7.7 → 8)

For future sub-season work. The current staging `seasons.py` already
implements these policies — no operator decision required for the
7.7 → 8 launch.

| Column | Stage introduced | Current behaviour | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `insurance_tokens` (renamed from `wager_tokens` by T119) | 032/054 | preserve (not in reset UPDATE) | preserve — earned currency |
| `cosmetic_fragments` | 046 | preserve (not in reset UPDATE) | preserve — T118 currency |
| `cumulative_wins` | 049 (T106) | preserve (not in reset UPDATE) | **DO NOT reset** — T106 lifetime |
| `biggest_win_announced` | 043 (T90) | currently NOT reset — §6.1 adds the reset | reset to 0 |
| `bounty_claimed_date` | 044 (T117) | preserve | preserve — daily date-stamp |
| `catch_of_the_day_date` | 042 | preserve | preserve — daily date-stamp |
| `insurance_free_claimed_date` | 054 (T119) | preserve | preserve — daily date-stamp |
| `insurance_unlock_grant_given` | 054 (T119) | preserve | preserve — one-time grant |

---

## 1. TL;DR

The main server (`wheel-app/`, `wheeldb`) is currently in season
`7.7` (DB row: `season_number=8, name='7.7', ends_at=2026-06-26 23:59 BST`).
The entire Season 8 design — wager system, prestige, bounties, community
goals, singularity, loadouts, casino theme, all the schema — has been
built and tested in `wheel-app-staging/` over the last 5 weeks.

**Resolved operator decisions (2026-06-23):** the new season name is
**`Casino`**; the 7-day cadence stays (with the intent to do smaller
weekly sub-seasons like 8.1, 8.2 going forward); auto-spin is a
shop-gated upgrade (no pre-registration); the pot buff is 7d; the
rollover fires via cron (`/etc/cron.d/wheel-rollover`); the
`sync-staging.yml` GitHub workflow is **disabled** so it doesn't
interfere with the manual promotion. See §11 for all 7 decisions.

The migration has two halves:

1. **Promote the work** — push staging's 54-migration series and Season 8
   code from the `staging` branch to `master`, deploy, and **verify the
   live server still runs cleanly while still in 7.7** (i.e. the S8
   columns exist, but the live game is still in 7.7 mode).
2. **Rollover to Casino** — at the scheduled time, the cron
   (`/etc/cron.d/wheel-rollover` → `bin/rollover.sh`) POSTs to
   `/api/admin/advance-season` to snapshot the current 7.7 standings,
   reset `game_state` (with the new S8 reset clauses), reset
   `community_pot` to S8 starting values, and bump `seasons` to the
   new number + name (`'Casino'`).

The historical breakage is **always** "we forgot to add the new S8
fields to the reset UPDATE" or "we ran the migration on the wrong DB".
This plan makes both impossible to forget by adding a **dry-run
verification on staging** as a hard gate.

## 2. State of things (as of 2026-06-23)

### Main (`wheeldb`, port 5000)

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| Branch | `master` |
| Code | Season 7.7 (no wager, no prestige, no bounties, no casino) |
| `game_state` columns | 49 S7-era columns (no `wager_*`, `prestige_*`, `cumulative_wins`, `auto_spin_budget`, `guard_*`, `resilience_*`, `legacy_wins`, `caught_species`, `equipped_class`, etc.) |
| Last migration applied | `030_drop_shield_charges` (2026-05-13) — schema_migrations has 30 rows |
| `seasons` row | `season_number=8, name='7.7', ends_at=2026-06-26 23:59:00+01` |
| `season_snapshots` | 21 rows (3 winners × 7 seasons) |
| `user_season_history` | 50 rows, S7-era columns only |
| Active players | 3 (tom7, worm67, dylan) — see `SEASON_8_PLANNING.md` for details |
| Gunicorn arbiter | PID 319 (port 5000 master, conf `gunicorn.conf.py`); 4 workers on 5000. PIDs are ephemeral — verify with `pgrep -af gunicorn` at T-30 |
| Uncommitted edits | `static/app.js`, `static/app.jsx` (do not lose) |
| Backup cron | `0 3 * * * /home/user/backup-wheeldb.sh` — 03:00 UTC daily, last 14 days retained |

### Staging (`wheeldb_staging`, port 5001)

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| Branch | `staging` |
| Code | Full Season 8 (wager, prestige, bounties, community goals, singularity, loadouts, casino theme, mobile drawer) |
| `game_state` columns | 68 (all S7 + 19 new S8 columns; the S8 count grew by 2 since the original plan via T117 + T119) |
| Last migration applied | `054_rename_wager_to_insurance_tokens` (2026-06-26); 54 rows in `schema_migrations` |
| `seasons` row | `season_number=7, name='' (EMPTY), ends_at=2026-05-01 23:59:00+01` (stuck at 7, intentionally — used to test S8 mechanics in isolation) |
| `season_snapshots` | 6 rows (no real seasons rolled over yet — staging has never run `advance_season()` end-to-end; see §6.1 shield_charges bug) |
| Gunicorn arbiter | PID 243257 (port 5001 master); 4 workers. PIDs are ephemeral |
| `ADMIN_SECRET` | **NOT set in staging `.env`** (only main's `.env` has it: `ADMIN_SECRET=d4da0a…`). The §6.1 dry-run therefore bypasses the HTTP endpoint and calls `seasons.advance_season(conn)` directly from Python |

### The gap (what main is missing)

Main's `seasons.py` knows nothing about Season 8. The reset UPDATE in
`_perform_rollover` resets S7 fields and stops. After the migration, the
S8 fields need to be in the reset too — otherwise they leak across
seasons. See §6 below for the full list.

Main's `game_state` is missing every S8 column. The S8 schema migrations
(031, 032, 036, 038, 039, 040, 041, 042, 043, 044, 045, 046, 048, 049,
050, 051) need to land in main before the rollover, or the reset UPDATE
will fail with `column does not exist`.

---

## 3. The rollover mechanism (unchanged from main)

`POST /api/admin/advance-season` (`game.py:3093`), with header
`X-Admin-Secret: $ADMIN_SECRET`, calls `seasons.advance_season(conn)`:

1. Lock + read the `seasons` row (`FOR UPDATE`).
2. Snapshot top 3 → `season_snapshots` (positions 1-3).
3. Snapshot every user → `user_season_history` (full state, including
   `equipped_fish`, `equipped_class`, `owned_items`, `active_cosmetics`).
4. Reset `game_state` (wins/losses, all upgrade levels, all flags, items,
   theme). **This is the step that needs updating for S8 — see §6.**
5. Reset `community_pot` (target=40000, win_chance=51.0, filled=false).
6. Bump `seasons` (number+1, started_at=NOW(), ends_at=NOW()+7d).
7. `SET LOCAL synchronous_commit = on` + commit — force WAL flush for
   the one critical weekly tx.

The endpoint is **manual-trigger only** (commit `a2bf578` explicitly
removed auto-rollover). No code path inside the server calls it. The
only triggers are: (a) the §6.6 cron entry firing `bin/rollover.sh`
at the scheduled time, and (b) the operator-fallback curl in §7 T-0.
Both require the `ADMIN_SECRET` header — the endpoint never advances
the season without an explicit external call.

`ADMIN_SECRET` for main is set in `/home/user/wheel-app/.env`:
`ADMIN_SECRET=d4da0abe8a184c5958371d9123189ddcf9d9812031694b3e`

---

## 4. Historical breakage (don't repeat these)

From the commit log of `wheel-app`:

| Commit | What broke | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `1b2d07f` | season_number wrong | mid-season 7.7 fix bumped number instead of name |
| `50d37ff` | user_season_history missing columns | new S7 fields weren't in the INSERT SELECT |
| `2d541dc` | community_pot not being reset on rollover | pot reset was in a migration, not in `seasons.py` |
| `d56c505` | upgrade levels / stat columns not being reset | new S5 fields weren't in the reset UPDATE |
| `8b54343` | DB migrations 018+019 not applied to staging | staging was running on a stale DB |
| `915a2bf` | duplicate `register_season` route after merge | merge conflict not caught |
| `0c0574e` | comment-only migration files executed | `migrate.py` ran them as empty tx |

**Pattern:** every season adds new fields; the reset code never knows
about them. The fixes have all been "remember to update the reset
UPDATE" — which is easy to forget on a stressful migration night.

**The hard rule for S8:** the S8 reset UPDATE in `seasons.py` must be
written and tested on staging **before** the migration window opens.
No writing it "live" at midnight.

---

## 5. Scope

### In scope

- Promote the 24 S8 migrations (031–054 + the new 052) to main.
  - 031–051: existing S8 schema (21 files).
  - 053_bounty_per_claim.sql: T117 bounty per-claim tracking.
  - 054_rename_wager_to_insurance_tokens.sql: T119 insurance rename.
  - 052_user_season_history_s8.sql: created in §6.2 (the new
    `user_season_history` S8 columns).
- Promote the S8 code (game.py, models.py, seasons.py, app.jsx, etc.)
  to main.
- Update main's `seasons.py` to reset S8 fields in the rollover UPDATE.
- Update main's `seasons.py` to write S8 fields into `user_season_history`.
- Update main's `seasons.py` `community_pot` reset to S8 starting values.
- Update main's `seasons.py` `get_season_info` to surface the new season
  name correctly.
- Schedule + execute the rollover at the agreed time.
- Verify the rollover end-to-end on staging first.
- Verify the rollover end-to-end on main after.
- Patch-note the S8 launch.

### Out of scope

- New Season 9 mechanics (this is a 7.7 → 8 transition, not 8 → 9).
- Theme changes beyond what S8 already ships (Casino background is in).
- Any new columns not already in the S8 design.
- The top-3 vs top-5 winners inconsistency (tracked separately).
- Any frontend re-skin work for the rollover announcement (the existing
  hiatus page works).

---

## 6. Pre-migration work (must finish before the window)

### 6.1 — Re-verify S8 reset logic on staging

**Phase A — fix `seasons.py` BEFORE the dry-run.** The staging
`seasons.py::advance_season()` (see current source lines 116–145) has
several issues that must be fixed before any dry-run will succeed:

- [ ] **Remove the `shield_charges = 0,` line (line ~119)** — column
      was dropped by migration 030. This is a pre-existing bug noted
      in `tests/test_rollover.py:54`. Without removing it the entire
      `UPDATE game_state` would throw `column "shield_charges" does
      not exist` on first run, on staging OR main.
- [ ] **Add `name = 'Casino'` to the `UPDATE seasons` clause** (lines
      158–164). Currently the UPDATE sets only `season_number`,
      `started_at`, `ends_at` — without a `name` clause the new season
      row would inherit `name=''`, and `get_season_info` (line 211)
      falls back to `season_name=str(season_number)` → the UI would
      display `'9'` instead of `'Casino'`. The §6.5 operator decision
      is unimplemented until this is fixed.
- [ ] **Add the four missing reset clauses** to the `UPDATE game_state`
      block:
      - `wager_banked_losses = 0` (mirrors `wager_banked_wins = 0`)
      - `gravity_drift = 0` (clears wheel-mode bias carry-over)
      - `wager_last_win_amount = 0` (clears stale double-down escrow)
      - `biggest_win_announced = 0` (per-season jackpot-announced flag;
        T90 added the column; without reset, jackpots can't be
        re-announced next season)
- [ ] **Confirm decisions on the columns in the §0 audit table.**
      Per the recommendations there, the reset should:
      - Leave `insurance_tokens` untouched (preserve earned currency;
        T119 rename from `wager_tokens`).
      - Leave `cosmetic_fragments` untouched (preserve T118 currency).
      - Leave `cumulative_wins` untouched (lifetime — T106 tier gate).
      - Leave `bounty_claimed_date`, `catch_of_the_day_date`,
        `insurance_free_claimed_date` untouched (date-stamped, reset
        by UTC date flip via their own logic).
      - Leave `insurance_unlock_grant_given` untouched (one-time grant).
      If any of these decisions disagree, edit the §6.1 reset block
      to add the explicit reset clause.
- [ ] Wait for §6.2 (the migration 052 + the
      `INSERT INTO user_season_history` edit) before running the
      dry-run — otherwise the INSERT in step 3 of `advance_season()`
      won't populate the new columns.

**Phase B — the dry-run.** The original plan called `POST
/api/admin/advance-season` on staging. That doesn't work cleanly
because staging `.env` has no `ADMIN_SECRET`. Use the direct
Python invocation instead — it bypasses HTTP and the secret check:

```bash
cd /home/user/wheel-app-staging
python3 - <<'PY'
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
import psycopg2
import seasons
conn = psycopg2.connect(os.environ['DATABASE_URL'])
try:
    # staging has 6 snapshot rows + season_number=7; take a fresh
    # backup first if you want to be able to revert (see Note below).
    seasons.advance_season(conn)
    print("ROLLOVER OK — see logs above for SEASON_ROLLOVER_START/DONE")
finally:
    conn.close()
PY
```

Then verify against the staging DB (use `psql -d wheeldb_staging`):

- [ ] `SELECT season_number, name FROM seasons;` returns
      `season_number=8, name='Casino'` (was 7 / empty).
- [ ] `season_snapshots` got 3 new rows for the current season (count
      goes from 6 to 9). `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM season_snapshots WHERE
      season_number=7;` → 3.
- [ ] `user_season_history` got 1 new row per user — and the new rows
      have non-default `wager_streak`/`legacy_wins`/`prestige_level`/
      etc. populated by the §6.2 INSERT edit.
- [ ] `game_state` wins/losses/levels all reset to 0.
- [ ] `game_state` `legacy_wins` ACCUMULATED (new value = old value
      + old wins).
- [ ] `game_state` `prestige_level`/`prestige_count` reset to 0.
- [ ] `game_state` `wager_streak`/`wager_banked_wins`/
      `wager_banked_losses`/`wager_last_win_amount` all reset to 0.
- [ ] `game_state` `gravity_drift` reset to 0.
- [ ] `game_state` `biggest_win_announced` reset to 0.
- [ ] `game_state` `active_wheel_mode` reset to `'steady'`.
- [ ] `game_state` `insurance_tokens` is **unchanged** (preserved).
- [ ] `game_state` `cosmetic_fragments` is **unchanged** (preserved).
- [ ] `game_state` `cumulative_wins` is **unchanged** (preserved; this
      is the lifetime counter gated on by T106).
- [ ] `community_pot` reset to `target=40000`, `win_chance_pct=51.0`,
      `filled=false`, `filled_at=NULL`, `total_contributed=0`.
- [ ] `/api/season` returns the new number and the new `ends_at` (need
      to set a temporary `ADMIN_SECRET` in staging `.env` OR just query
      `get_season_info` from a Python shell — see Phase B example).

If any of those fail on staging, **fix the staging `seasons.py` first**
and re-test. Do not promote a broken reset to main.

> **Note:** the dry-run rolls staging's season forward (7 → 8 → and so
> on). Staging `seasons.ends_at` will move to `now+7d`, which is fine
> for a dev env. To reset the staging `seasons` row back to 7 + the
> May 1st `ends_at` after the dry-run, either take a `pg_dump
> wheeldb_staging` first and restore it, or issue a manual UPDATE:
> `UPDATE seasons SET season_number=7, name='', ends_at='2026-05-01
> 23:59:00+01' WHERE id=1;`.

### 6.2 — `user_season_history` is missing the S8 columns — schema AND code

**Audit 2026-06-26:** the original plan was correct on the structural
point but listed some column names that T119 has since renamed. Updated
below.

**Status confirmed against the live `wheeldb_staging` schema
2026-06-26:** `\d user_season_history` on staging shows only the
18 S7-era columns — no migration in 031–054 ever touches this table
(only `000_baseline` and `026_history_upgrade_snapshot` do, both
pre-S8).

Worse, even if the columns existed: the `INSERT INTO
user_season_history` inside `advance_season()` in `seasons.py`
(lines 85–99) only writes the legacy S7 fields today (`final_wins`,
the upgrade levels, `equipped_class`, etc.) — it has zero references
to any S8 column. Adding the migration alone wouldn't snapshot
anything; the INSERT itself needs editing too.

Two changes needed:

1. A new migration `052_user_season_history_s8.sql` adding the S8
   columns to `user_season_history`. **Land this on staging first** so
   §6.1's dry-run can verify the INSERT actually populates the new
   columns. The migration must also be present on main's
   `migrations/` dir **before** `deploy.sh` runs §6.3 (else it won't
   be applied to `wheeldb`).
2. An edit to the `INSERT INTO user_season_history` statement in
   `seasons.py::advance_season()` to actually populate them — adds
   the column names to the column list AND the SELECT list.

Full column list (cross-checked against every column on staging
`game_state` 2026-06-26, minus pre-S8 cols already in the table and
minus the deliberate exclusions):

```
wager_streak, wager_last_stake, wager_banked_wins, wager_banked_losses,
insurance_charges, insurance_armed, wager_last_win_amount,
insurance_tokens, double_down_pending, active_wheel_mode,
auto_spin_budget, guard_charges, guard_last_regen_spin,
resilience_last_use_spin, legacy_wins, prestige_level, prestige_count,
cumulative_wins, gravity_drift, biggest_win_announced,
cosmetic_fragments, bounty_claimed_date, catch_of_the_day_date,
insurance_free_claimed_date, insurance_unlock_grant_given,
wager_last_stake (already listed above — dedup),
onboarding_step
```

Removed from the plan's earlier list (pre-T119 names that no longer
exist): `wager_insurance_charges`, `wager_insurance_armed`,
`wager_tokens` — migration 054 renamed them to `insurance_charges`,
`insurance_armed`, `insurance_tokens`.

Added vs the original list (newer columns the plan missed):
`biggest_win_announced` (T90), `cosmetic_fragments` (T118),
`bounty_claimed_date` (T117), `catch_of_the_day_date` (T118/042),
`insurance_free_claimed_date` + `insurance_unlock_grant_given` (T119),
`onboarding_step` (T88 — preserved across seasons, useful to snapshot).

Deliberate exclusions:

- `aquarium_species` — `game.py:212` notes it's never written
  anywhere; it's dead schema, not real player state.
- All `fishing_*`, `auto_*`, `dice_*`, `click_window_*`, `tab_*`,
  `proc_streak`, `low_spec_mode`, `suspicious_catches`, etc. — these
  are S7-era transient or anti-cheat state with no seasonal-meaning
  worth preserving in the permanent history table. (They are still in
  `game_state` and stay untouched across rollover, just not snapshotted.)

The migration is straightforward `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT
EXISTS …` with safe defaults (0 / FALSE / NULL as appropriate per
column). The `seasons.py` INSERT edit: append the new column names to
both the column list AND the `SELECT gs.…` list, in the same order.

### 6.3 — Promote staging → master (the code, not the rollover)

The promotion is handled by `deploy.sh` (existing on main at
`/home/user/wheel-app/deploy.sh`). It already automates: check clean
tree → merge staging → master → `migrate.py --dry-run` → prompt →
`migrate.py` → `make build` → clear bytecode cache → restart gunicorn
via `systemctl` (fallback: HUP). **Critical:** main must remain
functional while still in 7.7. The S8 schema migrations (031–054 +
new 052) add columns with safe defaults — they should be inert on 7.7.

**Pre-step (already done 2026-06-23):** the uncommitted `static/app.js{,x}`
edits in master (S7 timer fix) have been committed (`3c67350`) and merged
into staging (`4d8316f`). The `sync-staging.yml` workflow is disabled
(`7b3cf3f`) so the next push to master won't auto-merge.

**Sub-steps (in order):**

- [ ] Confirm staging `seasons.py` has all the §6.1 + §6.2 edits
      committed (the dry-run in §6.1 must have passed before this
      step).
- [ ] Confirm migration `052_user_season_history_s8.sql` exists in
      **main's** `migrations/` directory. Two options:
      - (preferred) Commit it to staging `migrations/` and let
        `deploy.sh`'s merge bring it across.
      - (acceptable) Add it directly to main's `migrations/` after
        the merge but before `migrate.py --dry-run` runs. Risk: the
        staging `migrations/` ledger and main's would diverge; the
        SHA match between branches only happens at the next staging
        merge.
- [ ] Run `./deploy.sh` from `/home/user/wheel-app/`. It will:
      - merge `staging` → `master` (130 commits between them as of
        2026-06-26; should be a clean fast-forward or a small set
        of conflicts in well-known spots — `seasons.py`, `app.jsx`,
        `static/styles.css`).
      - print `migrate.py --dry-run` listing the 24 pending
        migrations (031–054 + new 052).
      - prompt for confirmation.
      - apply the migrations to `wheeldb` on confirmation.
      - rebuild `static/app.js` from `static/app.jsx` via `make build`.
      - clear `__pycache__` and restart gunicorn.
- [ ] **If any migration fails** during the `migrate.py` run, STOP and
      roll back. Each migration in the 031–054 series is intended to
      be individually reversible per the existing pattern — but the
      failure may indicate a schema mismatch (e.g. a column already
      there). Inspect `schema_migrations`, the failed SQL, and the
      staging schema for the same column / constraint.
- [ ] Smoke test after `deploy.sh` returns: `curl http://localhost:5000/`
      returns 200, `/api/season` returns `season_number=8, name='7.7'`,
      login still works, can still spin. This proves 7.7 still
      functions with S8 code live (the S8 reset clauses are inert
      until the rollover fires).

### 6.4 — Update main's `seasons.py` (if not already via merge)

The staging `seasons.py` is the new main `seasons.py`. The merge in
§6.3 should bring it across (including the §6.1 + §6.2 edits).
After the merge, confirm:

- [ ] The reset UPDATE **does NOT contain `shield_charges = 0`**
      (the line was removed in §6.1; column was dropped by migration
      030). `grep -n shield_charges seasons.py` should return nothing.
- [ ] The reset UPDATE includes all S8 columns (see §6.1 checklist) —
      including `wager_banked_losses = 0`, `gravity_drift = 0`,
      `wager_last_win_amount = 0`, `biggest_win_announced = 0`.
- [ ] The reset UPDATE does NOT touch `insurance_tokens`,
      `cosmetic_fragments`, `cumulative_wins`,
      `bounty_claimed_date`, `catch_of_the_day_date`,
      `insurance_free_claimed_date`, `insurance_unlock_grant_given`
      (the §0 preserved-columns decision).
- [ ] The `UPDATE seasons` clause (lines 158–164) **includes
      `name = 'Casino'`** as well as `season_number`, `started_at`,
      `ends_at`. This is the §6.5 operator decision; the original
      staging code did NOT have it but the §6.1 fix adds it.
- [ ] The `user_season_history` INSERT includes all S8 columns
      (see §6.2).
- [ ] The `community_pot` reset values are S8 values
      (`target=40000, win_chance_pct=51.0, filled=false, filled_at=NULL,
      fib_prev=0, total_contributed=0, last_decay_check=NOW()`).
- [ ] The `get_season_info` returns `season_name='Casino'` once the
      rollover fires. Today, returning `'7.7'` for the still-current
      season is correct; after the rollover, the row's `name` column
      must be `'Casino'` (verified in §6.1 dry-run).
- [ ] `synchronous_commit=on` is still set (it is — staging kept it).
- [ ] No other side effects on the live 7.7 game (test login + spin).

### 6.5 — Decide the Season 8 name

**Decision (operator, 2026-06-23 — confirmed in §0 audit 2026-06-26):**
the new `seasons.name` will be **`'Casino'`** (matches the new
`page_season8` background, themed, and the existing `'7.7'` precedent
shows themed names are preferred over raw numbers).

**Code requirement (added in the §0 audit):** the staging
`seasons.py::advance_season()` `UPDATE seasons` clause (lines 158–164)
must be edited in §6.1 to include `name = 'Casino'`. The original code
does NOT set the name; without this edit, after rollover the row would
have `name=''` and the UI would display `season_name='9'` (the
`get_season_info` fallback to `str(season_number)`), not `'Casino'`.

The `get_season_info` already returns `season['name'] or str(season['season_number'])`,
so once the §6.1 edit lands the `'Casino'` non-blank name displays
correctly throughout the UI.

### 6.6 — Schedule the rollover

**Decision (operator, 2026-06-23):** **cron-driven** — a one-shot
cron entry that POSTs at the scheduled time. This is the primary
trigger; no manual fallback needed in normal operation (the
T-30 / T-5 pre-flight catches anything the cron would silently mess
up).

The schedule is **Friday 26 June 2026, 23:59 BST** — the same instant
`seasons.ends_at` already expires. In UTC that is **2026-06-26
22:59:00 UTC** (BST is UTC+1). Firing at this exact timestamp avoids
the earlier draft's confusion between "Friday" and "the first hour of
Saturday."

The cron entry will live in `/etc/cron.d/wheel-rollover`:

```
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
ADMIN_SECRET_FILE=/home/user/wheel-app/.env

# Season 8 launch: Friday 26 June 2026 23:59 BST = 22:59 UTC
# One-shot — delete this file after the rollover fires (or leave for
# future rollovers and update the schedule).
59 22 26 6 * user /home/user/wheel-app/bin/rollover.sh >> /var/log/wheel-rollover.log 2>&1
```

The `rollover.sh` wrapper script (new, lives in `wheel-app/bin/`)
loads `ADMIN_SECRET` from `.env` and POSTs:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
SECRET=$(grep ^ADMIN_SECRET /home/user/wheel-app/.env | cut -d= -f2)
RESP=$(curl -fsS -X POST -H "X-Admin-Secret: ${SECRET}" \
    http://localhost:5000/api/admin/advance-season)
echo "$(date -Iseconds) rollover fired: ${RESP}"
```

This is wrapped in a script (not inline in the crontab) so the secret
never appears in `ps` output or the crontab file itself.

### 6.7 — Pre-migration backup (belt and braces)

The 03:00 UTC daily backup (`backup-wheeldb.sh`) will run on the morning
of the migration. We want a **fresh backup taken immediately before**
the rollover as well. Either:

- Force a backup manually:
  ```
  /home/user/backup-wheeldb.sh
  ```
  immediately before the rollover, OR
- Rely on the 03:00 UTC backup and roll back to it if needed (loses up
  to ~21 hours of play data — acceptable for a season boundary where
  the next season starts from zero anyway).

**Recommendation: take a manual backup at 22:30 BST Friday, immediately
before the rollover.** That's the one we'd actually restore from.

---

## 7. Migration day procedure (Friday 26 June 2026 23:59 BST)

### T-30 minutes (23:30 BST Friday)

- [ ] Verify main is still on 7.7: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/season`
      returns `season_number=8, name='7.7'`.
- [ ] Verify `/var/log/wheel-app/` shows no errors in the last 24h.
- [ ] Verify the cron entry from §6.6 is in place and will fire.
- [ ] Run `/home/user/backup-wheeldb.sh` and verify the backup file
      exists in `/home/user/backups/` and is non-empty.
- [ ] Tail the gunicorn log: `tail -f /home/user/wheel-app/gunicorn.log`
      in a second terminal — leave it open.

### T-5 minutes (23:55 BST Friday)

- [ ] Verify main is STILL on 7.7 (any spin/tick in the last 30 min is
      fine; just confirm the season hasn't bumped).
- [ ] Verify staging is up (so we can fall back to it if main blows up):
      `curl http://localhost:5001/` returns 200.
- [ ] Verify the staging `.env` has `ADMIN_SECRET` set, OR know the
      command needed to set it.

### T-0 (23:59 BST Friday = 22:59 UTC Friday)

- [ ] **The cron fires** automatically (`/etc/cron.d/wheel-rollover`
      → `/home/user/wheel-app/bin/rollover.sh`). The wrapper script
      loads `ADMIN_SECRET` from `.env` and POSTs to
      `/api/admin/advance-season`.
- [ ] If the cron silently fails, the **operator-fallback curl** is:
      ```
      curl -fsS -X POST -H "X-Admin-Secret: $ADMIN_SECRET" \
          http://localhost:5000/api/admin/advance-season
      ```
      (Emergency use only — the cron is the primary trigger.)
- [ ] **Watch the gunicorn log** for `SEASON_ROLLOVER_START` then
      `SEASON_ROLLOVER_DONE`. The whole thing should take < 5 seconds.
- [ ] If we see `SEASON_ROLLOVER_DONE`, go to §8.
- [ ] If we see an exception, go to §9 (rollback).

### T+5 minutes (00:05 BST Saturday)

- [ ] `curl http://localhost:5000/api/season` returns the new season
      number + the new `ends_at` (should be 7 days from now).
- [ ] `psql` query: `SELECT * FROM seasons;` shows the bumped row.
- [ ] `psql` query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM season_snapshots WHERE season_number = 8;`
      returns 3.
- [ ] `psql` query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_season_history WHERE season_number = 8;`
      returns the user count (8 users).
- [ ] `psql` query: `SELECT total_contributed, target, win_chance_pct, filled FROM community_pot WHERE id = 1;`
      shows the reset values.
- [ ] `psql` query: spot-check one user's `game_state` row — wins=0,
      losses=0, all upgrade levels=0, `legacy_wins` is the **old value
      + their final wins** (not just their final wins), `active_wheel_mode`
      is `'steady'`.

### T+15 minutes (00:15 BST Saturday)

- [ ] Login to the live site as one of the 3 active users and verify:
      the S8 UI is live, the wager panel works, the casino background
      renders, the page theme is `page_season8`.
- [ ] If any of those fail, the S8 code didn't take. See §9.

### T+1 hour (01:00 BST Saturday)

- [ ] Confirm no errors in gunicorn log since the rollover.
- [ ] Confirm at least one user has spun and the S8 wager flow works.
- [ ] Announce the launch (patch notes / chat / etc. — out of scope for
      this document but should be on the checklist).

---

## 8. Post-migration verification checklist

(This is the same as §7 T+5/T+15, called out as a permanent checklist
for the migration record.)

### Database state

- [ ] `seasons.season_number` = previous + 1
- [ ] `seasons.name` = the new S8 name (TBD)
- [ ] `seasons.started_at` = the rollover timestamp
- [ ] `seasons.ends_at` = `started_at` + 7 days
- [ ] `season_snapshots` has 3 new rows for the old season
- [ ] `user_season_history` has 1 new row per user for the old season
- [ ] `community_pot.total_contributed` = 0
- [ ] `community_pot.target` = 40000
- [ ] `community_pot.win_chance_pct` = 51.0
- [ ] `community_pot.filled` = false
- [ ] Spot-check: every `game_state` row has `wins = 0`,
      `legacy_wins = (old legacy_wins) + (old wins)`, all upgrade levels
      = 0, `active_wheel_mode = 'steady'`, all S8 fields reset to their
      defaults (NOT carried over).

### Application state

- [ ] `/api/season` returns the new season info (number, name, ends_at)
- [ ] `latest_winners` array in `/api/season` has 3 entries for the
      previous season
- [ ] Login still works for the 3 active users
- [ ] One user can spin, see the wager panel, place a 0% stake, win
- [ ] The casino page background is rendering
- [ ] No errors in gunicorn log since the rollover

### User-facing

- [ ] Season countdown / banner in the UI shows the new season
- [ ] Patch notes (if any) are linked from the announcement
- [ ] The hiatus page (if it was shown) is gone

---

## 9. Rollback plan

If anything in §7 or §8 goes wrong:

1. **Stop the site** — `sudo systemctl stop wheel-app` (or HUP the
   gunicorn master). Prevents users from accumulating state we can't
   reverse.
2. **Restore the DB** from the manual backup taken in §6.7:
   ```
   gunzip -c /home/user/backups/wheeldb_20260626_225500.sql.gz | \
       psql -h localhost -U wheelapp -d wheeldb
   ```
   (Substitute the actual filename. Verify the count of rows in
   `game_state` and `users` matches the pre-rollover state.)
3. **Restart gunicorn.**
4. **Verify** the live site is back on 7.7 with the pre-rollover data.
5. **Diagnose** what went wrong by inspecting the gunicorn log +
   `schema_migrations` + the failed SQL.
6. **Fix on staging** (never on main). Re-test the full rollover
   procedure on staging with the fix.
7. **Re-attempt** the migration in the next window. There is no rush
   — better to ship it right than to ship it now.

**If we can't diagnose within 2 hours:** announce the rollback in
chat / patch notes. The site stays on 7.7 for another week. The S8
work in main is still there, just inert. Nothing is lost.

## 10. Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| S8 schema migrations fail to apply on main | Low | High | Dry-run in §6.3; stop on first failure |
| S8 reset UPDATE references a column that doesn't exist | Medium | High | §6.1 dry-run on staging; §6.2 schema migration for `user_season_history` |
| `legacy_wins` doesn't accumulate (forgot `legacy_wins = legacy_wins + wins`) | Medium | Medium | §6.1 verification checklist |
| S8 code crashes on a 7.7 game_state row (unexpected NULLs, etc.) | Medium | High | §6.3 smoke test after promote |
| Staging advance-season fires by accident on main | Low | Critical | Endpoint requires secret; only cron + operator have it |
| Rollback restores wrong backup (stale, partial) | Low | Critical | Verify backup file size + table count before restoring |
| Cron doesn't fire (typo, env not loaded) | Medium | High | Pre-flight check at T-30 in §7; manual fallback |
| The new S8 name isn't set / is wrong | Low | Low | Operator decides in §6.5; can be fixed with a small UPDATE later |
| The 3 active users log in at midnight and see a half-rolled-over state | Low | High | The whole rollover is one tx, atomic; either it works or it doesn't |
| S8 code has a hidden dep on something the staging DB has but main doesn't | Medium | High | §6.3 smoke test (login + spin) catches this |

---

## 11. Operator decisions (resolved 2026-06-23)

1. ✅ **S8 season name** → **`'Casino'`** (themed, matches the new
   `page_season8` background; the `'7.7'` precedent shows themed names
   are preferred over raw numbers). The rollover will set
   `seasons.name = 'Casino'` in the same UPDATE that bumps
   `season_number`.

2. ✅ **`ends_at` strategy** → **keep the 7-day pattern**. The intent
   (per operator) is to move to **smaller weekly sub-seasons**
   (8.1, 8.2, …) featuring balance changes and new features (e.g. new
   wheel spin modes), rather than large full-mechanic rollovers. The
   weekly cadence stays; the reset scope shrinks. See §11a below for
   what this means for the rollover mechanism.

3. ✅ **Pre-registration for auto-spin start** → **not needed** for
   S8. Auto-spin is gated on the `auto_spin_unlock` shop upgrade
   (5,000 wins, T107) — players must buy it to use it. The
   `season_registered` flag becomes informational only; the rollover
   still resets it to FALSE but nothing depends on it for S8.

4. ✅ **Community pot buff duration** → **keep 7d** (the S8 value).
   Reset applies to the 8.1 sub-season as well (pot starts fresh each
   sub-season).

5. ✅ **Trigger mechanism** → **cron**. One-shot entry in
   `/etc/cron.d/wheel-rollover` calls a wrapper script
   (`bin/rollover.sh`) that loads `ADMIN_SECRET` from `.env` and POSTs
   to `/api/admin/advance-season` at the scheduled time. Manual
   fallback is the T-0 curl in §7 (for emergency use only).

6. ✅ **Uncommitted JSX edits in main** → **committed and merged to
   staging** (2026-06-23). The 2 uncommitted files were the S7 timer
   fix (commit `3c67350`), unrelated to S8. Now both `master` and
   `staging` share this fix; staging's working tree picks it up via
   the merge commit (`4d8316f`).

7. ✅ **`sync-staging.yml` workflow** → **disabled** (commit `7b3cf3f`,
   2026-06-23). The auto-merge workflow was failing on the latest
   master push (S7 timer fix) because staging's S8 working tree
   conflicts with the timer fix's `app.jsx`/`app.js` changes. Renamed
   `.github/workflows/sync-staging.yml` →
   `.github/workflows/sync-staging.yml.disabled` (GitHub Actions only
   picks up `.yml`/`.yaml` files, so the rename is the cleanest
   disable). A header comment in the disabled file explains how to
   re-enable (`git mv` back to `.yml`).

---

## 11a. Sub-season model (8.1, 8.2, …) — follow-up design

The 7-day `ends_at` cadence implies weekly sub-seasons. These need a
different reset model than the 7.7 → 8 boundary:

- **7.7 → Casino (this migration):** full reset (wins=0, levels=0,
  items reset, `legacy_wins` accumulates, etc.) — the existing
  `_perform_rollover` logic.
- **Casino → 8.1 → 8.2 → … (future sub-seasons):** **partial reset**
  — preserve wins/levels/items, but reset the community pot, update
  the name, reset `active_wheel_mode` and a few transient flags. The
  current `_perform_rollover` does a full reset; it will need a `mode`
  parameter (e.g. `'full'` vs `'sub'`) to support sub-seasons.

**Out of scope for this migration.** The 7.7 → Casino transition is a
full reset. The sub-season model is a follow-up design ticket
(T110 or similar) for after launch. For the S8.1 rollover, the
operator can either:
- Run the full reset again (acceptable for the first sub-season —
  it's the same code path as the main migration), OR
- Update the cron command to set `ends_at` without calling
  `advance_season`, leaving game state intact.

The 7-day cron will keep firing the full reset until a sub-season
mode is implemented; this is a known-design-debt item, not a
migration-night concern.

## 13. After the migration

- T109 gets a status update with the timestamp + a summary of what
  happened (any deviations from this plan, any issues hit, any follow-up
  tickets created).
- `SEASON_8_PROGRESS.md` gets a "Migration 2026-06-27" section with
  the verification checklist completed + the new season state recorded.
- A new ticket is filed for any issue discovered during verification
  (e.g. a field that didn't reset, a UI element that didn't render).
- The 03:00 UTC backup from Friday is kept indefinitely (don't let the
  14-day retention cycle delete it) as the S8-launch reference point.
