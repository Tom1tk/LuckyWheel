"""Shared pytest fixtures for the mobile / e2e test suite.

T232: extract the duplicated server/db/playwright fixtures from the
~9 test files that boot a Flask server, register users, and drive
the UI with Playwright (`test_aquarium_panel`, `test_arm_button_truncation`,
`test_mobile_drawer_style`, `test_mobile_e2e`, `test_mobile_mode_centering`,
`test_onboarding_disabled`, `test_prestige_tooltip`, `test_season_info_display`,
`test_wager_panel_layout`).

Fixtures:
  - `db_url`              — DATABASE_URL (env, with .env fallback; no hardcoded literal)
  - `server_url`          — boot Flask in a subprocess on a free port
  - `playwright_instance` — module-scoped `sync_playwright()` context
  - `browser`             — function-scoped chromium browser (fresh per test)

The DB-backfill tests (`test_backfill_season8_theme`,
`test_legacy_wins_separation`) have their own `db_url` fixture with extra
safety guards (read from a fixed staging `.env` path, assert the URL
looks like staging) — they are intentionally NOT consolidated here.
T234 will rotate the staging credential and refactor the remaining
literal-bearing helpers across the test files.

# ── T242: pre-load flask_limiter (T242 follow-up) ───────────────────────────
# A few test modules do real `import game` / `import community_goals` /
# `import fish` at module load time. Those cascade through chat.py →
# extensions.py → flask_limiter → flask.{wrappers,ctx,signals,...}.
#
# Pre-T242, sibling test files used `sys.modules.setdefault(<name>, <stub>)`
# at module-load time, and whichever file was collected first won the race
# — so by the time `test_community_goals.py` was collected, `flask` was
# already the stub. T242 moved those into setup_module (post-collection),
# leaving a window where `import community_goals` triggers the real
# chain and fails.
#
# Fix: pre-load flask_limiter and flask_login here so their import
# chains run at conftest import time, NOT during pytest collection.
# If the chains fail here, we surface a clear error rather than
# letting collection fail with a confusing traceback.
